# ðŸŒ† Luta ImobiliÃ¡ria

**Luta ImobiliÃ¡ria** is a terminal-based RPG-style game built using Swift. It was my first project using this programming language and was developed collaboratively with [@Francisco](https://github.com/LosadaT) and [@Gustavo](https://github.com/7uigi/projeto). Inspired by early 2000s RPGs, the game uses ASCII art for visuals and is set against the backdrop of SÃ£o Paulo's real estate crisis, exploring social and economic themes in an engaging way.

## Narrative

The game is set during the real estate crisis in SÃ£o Paulo, where gentrification and the collapse of affordable housing options have dramatically affected the city. Players take on the role of a character who must navigate this turbulent urban landscape, dealing with issues like housing instability, economic inequality, and corporate greed.

As players progress through the game, they will face moral dilemmas, engage in battles against adversaries representing various societal forces, and solve puzzles related to economic and political struggles. The game's ending depends on the choices the player makes throughout, offering multiple paths and outcomes based on their actions.

The central conflict revolves around the main antagonist, a powerful real estate mogul who seeks to dominate the city's property market at the expense of its residents. Players must defeat this antagonist in a final combat scenario that symbolizes the struggle of the common people against oppressive economic forces.
